# Maze Generator

#### Description

A maze generation and solving program which allows the user to generate mazes using a variety of algorithms (Primâ€™s, growing-tree, binary-tree, & hunt-and-kill). Start and end positions in a maze can be customized and the optimal path is found using the A* algorithm. Both generation and solving algorithms are implemented with visualization.


#### Usage

Install Python 3 and run the *generator.py* script:

`python generator.py` 

Mazes can be generated by pressing the following keys: 
- 'H' will generate a new maze using the hunt and kill algorithm
- 'B' will generate a new maze using the growing tree algorithm in backtrack mode
- 'P' will generate a new maze using the growing tree algorithm in random (Prim's) mode
- 'T' will generate a new maze using the binary tree algorithm

The following additional controls are also available:
- 'C' will reset the grid
- 'R' will reset the maze (remove solution)
- SPACE will find the shortest path between start and end using the A* algorithm

Once a maze is generated, in order to place a start position (blue), left click a single time on the desired cell. The end position (orange) can be created on the desired cell by left clicking a second time.
